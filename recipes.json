Once the oil is hot enough that a rosemary leaf sizzles immediately when added to the pan, add the rosemary and walnuts. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the rosemary is crispy and the walnuts are golden brown. Leaving any oil in the pan, transfer the fried rosemary and walnuts to a paper towel-lined plate. Immediately season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nAdd the pasta to the pot of boiling water; cook according to package instructions or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1\/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.\r\n\r\nCook the kale:\r\nAdd 2 teaspoons of olive oil, the shallot, and the garlic to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the kale and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted. Add the vinegar (be careful, as the liquid may splatter) and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Add the heavy cream and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\nAdd the cooked pasta, butter, and half the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan of cooked kale. Cook on medium-high, stirring vigorously, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta is thoroughly coated. (If the pasta seems dry, gradually add the remaining cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the finished pasta between 2 dishes. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with the fried rosemary and walnuts. Garnish with the cheese. Enjoy!",

Drain pasta in a colander but do not rinse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, melt the butter in a 3-quart saucier or saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until the mixture is pale blond, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the mustard, paprika and onion and cook another minute. Whisk in the milk and cook over medium-high heat, whisking often for 7 to 8 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nLightly beat the egg in a small bowl then drizzle in about half a cup of the milk mixture, whisking constantly. Then, whisk the egg mixture into to the milk mixture. (This common maneuver called “tempering” prevents curdling of the egg by slowly increasing their temperature. Skip this and you’ll be making scrambled eggs.) Stir in the cheese, 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Fold in the macaroni then move to a 4-quart casserole or soufflé dish.\r\n\r\nSprinkle with the remaining cheese, then toss the breadcrumbs with the melted butter and distribute evenly over the top.

Add the sliced **white bottoms of the scallions**; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until slightly softened. Add the **tomato paste** and **chile paste**. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Add **water** (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat. Stir in the **sour cream or crema** and season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\nSpread about 2 cups of the filling into the bottom of a baking dish. Place the **tortillas** on a work surface. Divide the remaining filling among the tortillas; tightly roll up each tortilla around the filling. Transfer to the baking dish in an even layer, seam side down. Evenly top with the sauce and **grated cheese**. Season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nBake the enchiladas 7 to 9 minutes, or until lightly browned and the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven. Let stand at least 2 minutes before serving. Garnish the baked enchiladas with the sliced **green tops of the scallions**. Enjoy! \r\n",

It helps to wet your fingers when your shaping the rice.\r\n\r\n3. Spread the mayo and mustard on top of the rice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then pile on the veggies. Spoon some more rice on top of the veggies and form into another square. Tightly, but gently fold up the corners of the nori so that it completely covers the rice. Then fold up two corners of the plastic wrap to cover the nori and hold it in place. Place a piece of julienned carrot perpendicular to the way the ingredients run on top so that you know which direction to slice the onigirazu. Then fold up the last two sides of plastic wrap and set aside for at least 5 minutes and up to overnight.\r\n\r\n4. When ready to serve, slice the onigirazu along the length of the carrot you placed on the outside, remove the plastic wrap and enjoy.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.\r\n\r\nWhisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly, with some of the butter remaining in larger pieces.\r\n\r\nMix in the cheese, chives, and bacon until evenly distributed.\r\n\r\nAdd \u00be cup of the cream, stirring to combine. Try squeezing the dough together; if it's crumbly and won't hang together, or if there are crumbs remaining in the bottom of the bowl, add cream until the dough comes together. Transfer the shaggy dough to a well-floured work surface.\r\n\r\nPat the dough into a smooth 7\" disk about 3\/4\" thick. Transfer the disk to the prepared baking sheet. Use a knife or bench knife to cut the disk into 8 wedges, spreading the wedges apart a bit on the pan.\r\nBrush the scones with a bit of cream; this will help their crust brown.\r\n\r\nBake the scones for 22 to 24 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\nWant to make scones now, freeze and bake later? Make scones up to the point they're on the baking sheet, cut and ready to bake; don't brush them with cream. Freeze, then remove from the sheet, and wrap airtight in a plastic bag. When you're ready to bake, remove however many you want to bake from the freezer, place on a baking sheet, brush with cream, and bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.\r\n\r\nMake mini-scones: Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a 5\" round. Cut each round into 8 wedges. Bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven till golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes; or for about 25 minutes if frozen.",

If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nFOR THE ICING\r\n\r\n1. Whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nIn case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. To reheat, move to a small plate (I usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. Four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nTo freeze: Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. When ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. Then microwave for 30 seconds.",

Combine the cream cheese, sugar and flour in a small bowl, and mix until smooth. Add the egg yolk and flavoring (if using), mixing until smooth once again. Transfer the mixture to a disposable pastry bag, and cut just the very tip off the end, as shown.\r\n\r\n2. Place a small pool of the mixture in the center of the brownie batter. Draw circles around this pool, about 1 inch apart, moving out from the center each time.\r\n\r\n3. Once the circles are drawn, take a table knife, wet the tip, and draw it back and forth through the circles.\r\n\r\n4. The knife will draw the cream cheese filling into arcs, as you see here. Once you've gone all the way around the circles, take up your pastry bag again.\r\n\r\n5. Use the remaining filling to trace the path where the knife travelled, to create the spokes of the web.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, until the brownies just barely pull away from the edge of the pan. The center will rise while baking, but will sink back level once the brownies are cool.

Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110\u00b0F to 120\u00b0F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.\r\n\r\n4) Add the hot butter\/sugar mixture to the egg\/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.\r\n\r\n5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth. Note: If you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies, rather than melting in, let the batter cool in the bowl for about 20 minutes before stirring in the chips.\r\n\r\n6) Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan.\r\n\r\n7) Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it.

Sprinkle in the flour and stir. Cook for 1 minute before deglazing the pan with the beer. Add the remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and put it in the oven to braise until the beef is tender, about 2 hours. Remove the pot from the oven and transfer the pot roast to a serving dish.",

Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\r\n\r\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",
